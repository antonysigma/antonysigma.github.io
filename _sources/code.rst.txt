Code
=========

Here are my code I wrote for research projects or as a hobby.

.. figure:: attached/starchart.jpg

    Android Star Catalog on E-ink devices
    
    I created a "vanilla-flavoured" star map to run on E-ink readers, 
    so I can focus on the serious scientific details of each star. 
    The star positions are replicated from the 
    *Positions and Proper Motion Star Catalog* at NASA. There are plans to add 
    more deep sky objects (double stars, nebula, galaxies, etc.)
    from the WDS and NGC database.

    "Computerized" Chinese abacus
    
    Everybody knew that the abacus is the precursor of modern computer, but not 
    many realize it can be "programmed" to perform complex arithmetic computation.
    Based on the 500 year old instruction set, I demonstrate its ability to 
    perform basic arithmetic (positive or negative) on fixed point decimals 
    down to 20-digit precision. I have plans to realize long division and square root
    in the future.

    Online Cangjie Chinese input engine
    
    Chinese language is a logographic writing system, where one composes a sentence by visually "assembling" individual character with shapes, rather then verbally spelling the words with letters as in other languages. Traditionally, Chinese was typed on a computer with Cangjie, a free, open source program called the Cangjie input method. However, in a mandarin dominated world, it is increasing harder to type (or to Google) in Chinese on library workstations, or on my friend's smartphones. So, I created my own online input program and hosted it here:

    Mathematical coding challenge on Project Euler

    
    Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
