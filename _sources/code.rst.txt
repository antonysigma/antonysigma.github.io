MBSE-lite: system requirement tracking and design with a simplified schema
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://github.com/antonysigma/mbse-lite/blob/master/static/document-sources.png?raw=true

A simple platform to organize product design requirements. Text editor only.
Execute a single command to generate technical document for weekly design review
meetings. Inspired from `Nichole Kass's online presentation
<https://youtu.be/0MjopluRTaw>`_, the tools links the stakeholder's needs,
system design problems and solutions without paying for the unused MBSE
features, e.g. code generation, nested diagrams, and Matlab/Zemax parametrics
simulations.

**Why I made my own tool.**
As a giga-pixel microscopy researcher dealing with increasingly complex systems,
I found the need for an end-to-end requirement management system that traces
stakeholders' needs, functional requirements, design constraints, and physical
architecture. Additionally, I needed a tool to analyze how design solutions
(such as optical, mechanical, and electronic component specifications, software
interface specifications, and SOPs) can verify the requirements and be validated
with test plans.

The challenge arises from the prevalent document-oriented approach used by
research labs, startups, and OEM vendors. Traditionally, we rely on a
combination of PowerPoint slides, documents, and freehand drawings for
communication. As a project owner serving as a liason among vendors and
stakeholders, these methods are labor-intensive due to the use of incompatible
document processing tools, namely Confluence, emails, PDFs, and Word documents.
I often ended up spending more time copy editing documents from one vendor to
another, rather than focusing on the *design* itself.

I also explored the model-based system engineering (MBSE) approach, but found
that all existing commercial tools were overly bloated for medium-sized
projects. My projects often involve fewer than 50 project members, including
vendors; the commercial MBSE tools often intimidates them.

For example, I do not need the code generation feature since my software vendor
will develop their own software and test plans. Furthermore, allocating a
function to multiple instances is unnecessary as most functions in the system
are used exactly once for giga-pixel imaging projects. Similarly, Zemax and
Matlab integration into the parametric design module is not needed as most PhDs
develop their own simulation tools for academic publications.

Ultimately, these commercial tools are designed to cater to NASA-scale projects
and defense contractors with >1,000 head counts. For medium-sized projects, it
is unnecessary to pay for features we don't use.

ProxImaL: GPU-accelerated ISP code generation with 5th generation language
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/proximal-banner.png


ProxImaL is a modeling language for image reconstruction problems. It allows you
to express the signal distortion process in the optical imaging system in a
natural way that follows the math, and automatically determines an efficient
algorithm for solving the problem on baremetal single-board computer, e.g.
Nvidia Jetson Nano. ProxImaL makes it easy to experiment with the image features *a
posteriori*, and the noise distribution of the optical hardware *a priori*, without worrying about the
details of how the image restoration problem should be solved or implemented on hardware.

.. note::

   I am the maintainer of the ProxImaL project. Please report the bugs at

BioImage Coder for multi-camera, high-throughput instrument control
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Hyperlink to the source code: https://github.com/Caltech-Biophotonics-Lab/bioimage-coder


BioImage Coder grew out of a very specific problem: programming a complex,
high-throughput instrument where the cognitive load of reading low-level,
asynchronous control code from 96 cameras was getting in the way of reasoning
about the bio-imaging experiment goals itself. As a visual thinker, I wanted
domain experts to be able to describe what the instrument is doing without
having to mentally simulate that by monitoring packets/logs transmitted among
dozens of devices under the hood.

Imagine a world where one can read music on a book featuring multi-page,
multi-track music scores of the Beethoven symphony, rather than figuring out who
plays what instrument by listening to the FM/AM radio, without the ability to
playback the audio.

The result was a small domain-specific language (DSL) that emphasizes the
experiment design intent of the bio-imaging protocols, while still compiling
down to tightly controlled, timing-aware instrument control software with
zero-cost abstraction enabled by the compiler.

The working principle
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The two branches of R&D: system engineering and system integration, is prone to
impedance mismatch due to different pace of workload over the span of the
project.

De novo, high‑throughput bioimaging systems evolve rapidly over the course of
the project: optics, sensors, illumination, motion stages, and firmware
pipelines are redesigned over successive iterations to improve speed and signal
quality over the project lifetime. The pace of system engineering tapers to a
near halt through a sequence of "design lockdowns" near the product launch
phase.

In contrast, image capture protocols -- the ordered sequence of excitation,
exposure, motion, and acquisition steps -- encode scientific intent and changes
much more slowly. Protocol revision activities conducted by system integration
teams, e.g. post-design-lockdown synchronization tweaks and performance
mitigations, only ramps up when the project is close to product launch.

This asymmetry naturally forms an hourglass model:

- Top-down (Wide): Diverse experimental protocols (time‑lapse, Z‑stacks,
  multi‑channel fluorescence, mixed modalities)
- Middle (Narrow): A stable, precise, domain-expert‑readable DSL describing the
  protocol
- Bottom-up (Wide): Diverse hardware and firmware implementations optimized for specific instruments

Android Star Catalog on E-ink devices
---------------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/starchart.jpg

I created a "vanilla-flavoured" star map to run on E-ink readers,
so I can focus on the what matters during outdoor star gazing; to look up not down.
The star positions are replicated from the
NASA's *Positions and Proper Motion Star Catalog*. There are plans to add
more deep sky objects (double stars, nebula, galaxies, etc.)
from the WDS and NGC database.

"Computerized" Chinese abacus
-------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/abacus.jpg


Everybody knew that the abacus is the precursor of modern computer, but not
many realize it can be "programmed" to perform complex arithmetic computation.
Based on the 500 year old instruction set, I demonstrate its ability to
perform basic arithmetic (positive or negative) on fixed point decimals
down to 20-digit precision. I have plans to realize long division and square root
in the future.

Online Cangjie Chinese input engine
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/cangjie-logo.png


Chinese language is a logographic writing system, where one composes a sentence
by visually "assembling" individual character with shapes, rather then verbally
spelling the words with letters as in other languages. Traditionally, Chinese
was typed on a computer with Cangjie, a free, open source program called the
Cangjie input method. However, in a mandarin dominated world, it is increasing
harder to type (or to Google) in Chinese on library workstations, or on my
friend's smartphones. So, I created my own online input program and hosted it
here:

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
