Optics
########

Optical system design, as a business, has become very costly to run over the
past few years for freelancer CDMO (contracted development & manufacturing
officer), especially without purchasing authority and a host lab to support the
R&D. Nowadays, I mostly compose/evaluate optical schematics, and verify them
against OEM-provided specifications. If you find anyone who wishes to ship the
instrument on loan to my office, I am more than willing to pick up the slack.

Plastic molded microscope lens for 96-well parallel microscope
===============================================================

.. figure:: attached/plastic-molded-lens.png

Originally conceived by Dr Changhuei Yang and his PhD student, we spec'ed out
the optical magnification, field of view, and focal shift requirements from
the 96-CMOS camera project. When I took over the project, I reviewed
the manufacturer provided CodeV raytracing report, provided expert's feedback,
and then validated the lens and the specifications with the Caltech-patented
aberration extraction algorithm to analyze the Zernike coefficients.

2-Laser illumination engine for whole-plate fluorescence excitation, 7000 milliWatt per plate
================================================================================================

.. figure:: attached/illumination-optics.png

Laser pointers are often a foolproof solution to early instrument prototyping;
it is relatively easy to obtain laser-safety clearance, short lead time, as well
as the benefit of built-in/cost-effective laser driver circuits.

However, it often makes sense to re-architect the illumination optics in pursuit
of thermal stability, illumination homogeneity, as well as ease of optical
alignment. I assisted the original project owner to finish the evaluation phase
of the early prototype. Upon the scheduled disassembly, I reached out to
stakeholders to **re-capture the design constraints**, followed by choosing a
new system HW/FW/Optics architecture to meet the new requirements. The laser
pointer based design is replaced with an external light engine, coupled with
**homogenizing light pipes and COTS projection lenses**. I also custom-designed
the **thermal solutions, the laser driving electronics, as well as the laser
monitoring firmware**, interfacing the main instrument control board via I2C
bus.

**The context**
For a 6-well multi-modal imager (i.e. quantitative phase and widefield
fluorescence), it makes sense to design the illumination optics with one laser
diode per well per channel, in order to take advantage of the individual
addressable laser driving electronics to minimize photo-damage to live cells.
Having individual laser power controls also offer a larger degree of freedom in
laser power calibration, simplifying downstream cross-well data normalization
pipelines.

As the researchers migrate from the 6-well plate solution to the 96-well, it
makes sense to **replicate success by simply "copying" the design over**. In fact,
first generation `overhead projectors
<https://www.experimental-engineering.co.uk/2020/01/18/casio-xj-a140-hybrid-projector-teardown/>`_
and `concert lighshows <https://www.lightspaceusa.com/gallery>`_ replace halogen lamps
with laser diode knife-edge arrays to maximize the power-to-weight ratio.
However, as we packed 30 laser pointers into the prototype, we quickly met
various issues causing long system downtimes: thermal overload, laser driving
current variations, mechanical alignment, as well as uneven illumination.

It should be worth to note that the original prototype (i.e. simply mounting 30
individual laser pointers) is a huge success, as far as the primary
stakeholder's concern. Quoting a fellow R&D scientist from the book *Turning
Science into Things People Need: Voices of Scientists in Industry*, the
constantly-failing instrument performs exactly what it is designed to do; stays
online just long enough to capture R&D data for publications, before falling
apart the next (milli-)second. "This is a proof that we don't pay for what we
don't need for scientific discoveries."

**Nice to have features**
If I had sufficient funding, I would have contracted out the design to those
specializing in off-axis darkfield trans-illumination optics. I also would have
been more bold in freeform reflective optics; after all, what we truly need is a
pair of rectangular floodlight illuminated at a shallow angle. The 96-camera
system idea was also at least a decade ahead of its time; the DPSS laser diode
array (465 nm, ~35% fluorescence quantum efficiency) would have been replaced
with stacked GaN diode array on the wafer level (at 468 nm, 80% fluorescence
quantum efficiency), completely bypassing the optical pumping setup and the bulky
diode package.

All-optical spatial light modulator for structured illumination at 10 million FPS
==================================================================================

    :width: 80%

The holy grail of a spatial light modulator (SLM) is to bypass all mechanical
actuators in pursue of speed. At >10 million FPS range, the MEMS technology can
no longer meet the requirements. I designed, modelled, and validated the all-optical
SLM design on a physical optical setup.

Due to the cost prohibitive manufacturing and cleaning process of
the thin-glass optical cavity (VIPA), I coded an optical simulator based on wave propagation optics, and optimized
the SLM design parameter (e.g. thickness, reflectance, core material) based on multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA).
The optimized design is successfully fabricated, assembled, and validated on a physical system.


Acousto-optic beam deflection at 1 million sweeps per second for pixel super-resolution
===================================================================================================

.. figure:: attached/aod-beam-deflector.png

Under the lead of Dr Terence Wong, I procured the acousto-optic deflector (AOD) evaluation kit and
integrated it into his ultrafast imaging flow cytometry system for cancer detection. I brought up the
RF wave generator & amplifier module, and designed controller PCBs to synchronize incoming fempto-second laser pulses.
I also conducted AOD sweep angle and step size trade studies to further understand the limit of the system.
