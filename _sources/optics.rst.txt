Optics
########

I used to perform a lot of fundamental optics design, optimization, and fabrication in the past.
I verify the system architecture to meet the stakeholder needs, conducts trade studies with Fraunhofer/Poisson optical model,
and then validate the assembled hardware does meet the system specifications.

Later, I found the profession/hobby too expensive to sustain without a lab to support.
I mostly compose and evaluate optical schematics and OEM-provided specifications these days.
But... If you find anyone who wishes to ship
the instrument on loan to my garage, I am more than willing to pick up the trade. Please feel free to contact me on `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonycschan/>`_.

Plastic molded microscope lens for 96-well parallel microscope
===============================================================

.. figure:: attached/plastic-molded-lens.png

Originally conceived by Dr Changhuei Yang and his PhD student, we spec'ed out
the optical magnification, field of view, and focal shift requirements from
the 96-CMOS camera project. When I took over the project, I reviewed
the manufacturer provided CodeV raytracing report, provided export's feedback,
and then validated the lens and the specifications with the Caltech-patented
aberration extraction algorithm to analyze the Zernike coefficients.

All-optical spatial light modulator for structured illumination at 10 million FPS
==================================================================================

The holy grail of a spatial light modulator (SLM) is to bypass all mechanical
actuators in pursue of speed. At >10 million FPS range, the MEMS technology can
no longer meets the requirements. I designed, modelled, and validated the all-optical
SLM design on a physical optical setup.

Due to the cost prohibitive manufacturing and cleaning process of
the thin-glass optical cavity (VIPA), I built an optical simulator based on wave propagation optics, and optimized 
the SLM design parameter (e.g. thickness, reflectance, core material) based on multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA).
The optimized design is successfully fabricated, assembled, and validated on a physical system.


Acousto-optic beam deflection at 1 million sweeps per second for pixel super-resolution
===================================================================================================

Under the lead of Dr Terence Wong, I procured the acousto-optic deflector (AOD) evaluation kit and
integrated it in his ultrafast imaging flow cytometry system for cancer detection. I brought up the
RF wave generator & amplifier module, and designed controller PCBs to synchronize incoming fempto-second laser pulses.
I also conducted AOD sweep angle and step size trade studies to further understand the limit of the system.
