Antony C. Chan, PhD is an optical and computational imaging specialist with
experience spanning the entire high throughput sensing landscape, ranging from
high-speed microscopy (i.e.\ high frame rate, single pixel), to giga-pixel
superresolution camera design (i.e.\ low frame rate, high pixel count). He has
developed methods enabling million-FPS imaging cytometers, co-invented a
96-camera live-cell imaging hardware at Caltech, engineered tamper-proof mobile
imaging to combat news disinformation, and accelerated next-generation DNA
sequencing pipelines with FPGA/GPU capabilities. As an independent consultant,
he helps clients architect advanced imaging systems end-to-end---from optics
and motion control to firmware, algorithms, and scalable data pipelines---
delivering solutions that bridge cutting-edge research with deployable products
for real world applications.
