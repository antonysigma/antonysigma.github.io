Parallel frame grabber with 96 automative CMOS's for drug discovery
#####################################################################

.. figure:: attached/96-cmos-fpga.png


As part of the OEM provided design "ride-share" program, I contracted out the 96-CMOS single-board
camera and FPGA-based frame grabber card array design & fabrication. I drafted and negotiated the
pixel readout requirements, reviewed circuit schematics, and provided pre-fab feedback on the PCB's
thermal load and EMI. The 96-CMOS subsystem is successfully integrated into the parallel microscope
for high-throughput drug discovery at Amgen.
The "ride-share" program enables a shared domain knowledge with another customer, which in turn accelerated
the completion of similar projects.

.. _peltier-cooler:

4-channel Peltier PID cooler for 3.5Watt laser modules, 30W per channel
########################################################################

.. figure:: https://github.com/antonysigma/peltier-cooler-4ch/raw/master/preview.jpg

The custom PCB to control up to 4 individual Peltier coolers interfacing the high power laser modules.

Technical specifications:

* Input: 24VDC, max 20A.

* Output per channel: up to 10A, PWM at 5% to 100% duty cycle. 30N06L

* Recommended Peltier module: series-parallel modules supporting up to 24VDC
  input, with up to 50W heat transfer on the cold side.

* Temperature sensor: Dallas digital temperature sensor with One-Wire interface. DS18B20

* Microcontroller (MCU) power supply: 5VDC, max 200mA. Completely separated from the 12DVC supply.

* MCU programming interface: UART over TTL, via a 6-pin connector with the FTDI friend USB adapter.

* External set point control: I2C bus to reduce the cabling effort.

* Project website: https://github.com/antonysigma/peltier-cooler-4ch

**Why I made my own board** The board is primarily used to dissipate the waste
heat from the 3,000mW laser modules. A high laser power is required to
compensate the coupling loss of the homogenizing liquid light-guide and the TV
lens, so that I can excite the fluorescence-stained mammalian cells on all 96
wells of the multi-well plate (area: 180mm x 90mm).

At the time, there was an urgent need to create an evaluation board at less than
10% of the cost of the OEM laser parts. So, the OEM provided temperature
controller evaluation kits were a no-go.

If I had more time on the project, I would have enabled the staggered,
phase-correct PWM to minimize the transient current load. Staggered PWM
significantly reduces the dead time on the powerline, as well as reduces the EMI
noise.

Piezo-flexure nano-positioning stage control board
#################################################################

.. figure:: https://github.com/antonysigma/piezo-stage-pid-board/raw/master/preview.jpg

The PCB to implement z-stack focus scanning with a custom piezo-flexure nano-positioning stage.

Technical specifications:

* Power input: 5VDC, max 200mA.

* Output: analog output for the piezo class-A amplifier, bandwidth 250kHz max, dual rail +/- 5V via the 50 Ohm coaxial cable.

* Position sensor: linear encoder with differential quadrature TTL output.

* MCU programming interface: UART over TTL, via a 6-pin connecter with the FTDI friend USB adapter.

* External position control: I2C bus to reduce the cabling effort.

* Project website: https://github.com/antonysigma/piezo-stage-pid-board

**Why I made my own board**
The board is primarily used to actuate the Piezo-flexure nano-positioning Z-axis
stage at a step size of 5 micrometer; full travel range of 0~250 micrometer, and
a close-loop settle time of 50 millisecond. The 50 millisecond settle time
requirement originates from the need to avoid motion blur in the 96-camera
imaging light path; the stage must settle completely before the
flurorescence-excitation flash light can be turned on.

This is a line following car built entirely out of 74HC digital IC logic and LM
analog IC logic, with the focus of "form... shall ever follows function". The
following first principles are taught under the disguise of car race:

* **Optical physics:** how one can measure distance, offset, and specular
  reflectivity with an infrared proximity sensor;

* **Analog electronics:** how one can reduce measurement noise with
  signal-conditining RC circuits.

* **Digital signal processing:** how one can eliminate electronic component
  variations by digitizing the proximity sensor inputs. Why digital signals can
  enable in-circuit programming, as well as design verifications on paper.

* **Power electronics design:** how one can generate a PWM signal from OpAmps to
  convert the digital control signal to an analog control signal (sigma delta DAC),
  which in turn is used to drive the parallex motor on the wheels.

* **Design for manufacturing:** how the control board should be built to minimize
  damage due to shock and vibrations. How one can trade inventory complexity and
  system robustness when engineers sources for components.

* **Mechanical engineering:** how one can ensure wheel traction as a function of
  wheel diameter, torque, tire material, and rotation speed.

* **Close-loop control theory:** how one can tune the open-loop gain of the system
  to increase car speed, while minimizing oscillations and loss of line-tracking
  during turns, a Pareto-optiminal multi-criteria optimization problem.

**Why I make my own board**
Today's proliferation of complex embedded electronics has led to a
`Quadcore CPU-enabled soldering iron <https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/5G-enabled soldering>`_,
and a `line following car running rich Linux operating system <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-line-following>`_.
It breaks my heart that these advanced technologies, e.g. Raspberry Pi, FPGA, and Arduino, are made to serve such a humble application.
These system-on-boards (SoBs), and system-on-chip (SoCs) exist to solve a more sophisticated problem.

To be fair, these education kits are ideal for student's exposure to the
bleeding edge technologies; depending on where you live, it might help build
your resume as a salesperson boosting the component sales of the OEM vendors.
The strategy also helps the vendors because of the vendor lock-in and technology
inertia built into the education kits. However, they often fall short of
teaching the core STEM principle: "form shall ever follows function". To train
an inquiring scientific mind, one should first define *what* the robot should
behave to follow the track based on stakeholder's needs, not *how* the robot
should execute the program to steer the wheels. In other words, one
should build a *design* first, then map the design to the *technology*.
