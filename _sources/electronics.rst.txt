4-channel Peltier PID cooler for 3.5Watt laser modules, 30W per channel
########################################################################

.. figure:: https://github.com/antonysigma/peltier-cooler-4ch/raw/master/preview.jpg

The custom PCB to control up to 4 individual Peliter coolers interfacing the high power laser modules.

Technical specifications:

* Input: 24VDC, max 20A.

* Output per channel: up to 10A, PWM at 5% to 100% duty cycle. 30N06L
 
* Recommended Peltier module: series-parallel modules supporting up to 24VDC
  input, with up to 50W heat transfer on the cold side.
 
* Temperature sensor: Dallas digital temperature sensor with Onewire interface. DS18B20
 
* Microcontroller (MCU) power supply: 5VDC, max 200mA. Completely separated from the 12DVC supply.
 
* MCU programming interface: UART over TTL, via a 6-pin connecter with the FTDI friend USB adapter.
 
* External set point control: I2C bus to reduce the cabling effort.

**Why I made my own board** The board is primarily used to dissipate the waste
heat from the 3,000mW laser modules. A high laser power is required to
compensate the coupling loss of the homogenizing liquid light-guide and the TV
lens, so that I can excite the fluorescence-stained mammalian cells on all 96
wells of the multi-well plate (area: 180mm x 90mm).

At the time, there was an urgent need to create an evaluation board at less than
10% of the cost of the OEM laser parts. So, the OEM provided temperature
controller evaluation kits were a no go.

Piezo-flexure nano-positioning stage control board
#################################################################

.. figure:: https://github.com/antonysigma/piezo-stage-pid-board/raw/master/preview.jpg

The PCB to implement z-stack focus scanning with a custom piezo-flexure nano-positioning stage.

Technical specifications:

* Power input: 5VDC, max 200mA.

* Output: analog output for the piezo class-A amplifier, bandwidth 250kHz max, dual rail +/- 5V via the 50 Ohm coaxial cable.

* Position sensor: linear encoder with differential quadrature TTL output.

* MCU programming interface: UART over TTL, via a 6-pin connecter with the FTDI friend USB adapter.

* External position control: I2C bus to reduce the cabling effort.

* Project website: https://github.com/antonysigma/piezo-stage-pid-board

**Why I made my own board**
The board is primarily used to actuate the Piezo-flexure nano-positioning Z-axis
stage at a step size of 5 micrometer; full travel range of 0~250 micrometer, and
a close-loop settle time of 50 millisecond. The 50 millisecond settle time
requirement originates from the need to avoid motion blur in the 96-camera
imaging light path; the stage must settle completely before the
flurorescence-excitation flash light can be turned on.

I designed a phase lock loop (PLL) amplifier to generate a 10 MHz TTL signal synchronized to the ultrashort pulsed fiber laser at 400 femtosecond pulse width.
