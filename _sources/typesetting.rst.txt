Technical illustration
=======================

I do not offer technical illustration services anymore; it is no longer a
profitable business given the low wage and the emergence of text-to-figure
generative AIs, e.g. DALL-E. I still keep my own palette and pre-fab icons, in
case I need to create and present novel ideas to investors.

Mid-2019: Speckle generation infographics
-------------------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/scattering_medium.png
    :width: 30%

* Duration: 8 hours
* Purpose: lab meeting
* Drawing tools: Inkscape, LaTeX, `Public domain discrete optics symbols <https://github.com/amv213/ComponentLibrary>`_

The infographics (aka powerpoint slide) is quickly drafted to illustrate various
well known mechanisms of artificial (pseudo-random) speckle generation.
Originally meant for scientific publication, it failed to gain any traction
for its lack of novelty.

It is a stark reminder that even in academia settings, it is a high risk/low
reward scenario to spend time on drawing attractive figures just to prove the
scientific values, especially before R&D funding is released.

Mid-2017: 96-camera microscope
---------------------------------

* Duration: 75 hours
* Publication: Nature Scientific Reports
* Drawing tools: Inkscape, LaTeX, AutoCAD.

We have our own PowerPoint drawings for internal presentation and contractor
communications; simply not attractive enough for scientific publication. There
were also a need to highlight the benefit of shared illumination light paths for
adjacent CMOS camera, that is only visible in orthogonal projections.

Mid-2016: Speckle pattern coding nanoscopic imaging for single cell in-situ multi-omics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: attached/croucher-schematics.png
    :width: 50%

* Duration: 8 hours
* Purpose: research scholar application
* Drawing Tools: Inkscape

Research fellow applications are, by definition, radical and ahead of its time.
Therefore, as I was drafting the cover figure for the prospoal, I was
envisioning that DNA-code-multiplexing FISH (e.g. MERFISH, SNAIL) would be a
commodity technology by the time I won the research funding. I was trying to
apply computational imaging technique to novel bio-chemistry
sequencing-by-hybridization technology, also an unproven technology at the time.
Nowadays, as I traced my steps, I often wonder the road not trodden scenario
where I successfully developed and deployed the technology during the 2-year
tenure.

Late-2015: Holographic imaging for microscopic fluorescent objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://opg.optica.org/getimagev2.cfm?img=67SQCJTf12rVc94c%2BhD6uq%2F7UzrWCwJHDx10eeh1eLM%3D&uri=optica-3-8-911-g001

* Duration: 40 hours
* Publication: Optica, the Optical Society.
* Drawing tools: FreeCAD, Inkscape.

It is conventional wisdom that fluorescence objects cannot generate Gabor
holograms; a lot of effort is spent on fighting the presumptions. Three insets
are included to call out the signal generation mechanisms; optical beating is
responsible for encoding holographic phase information through the incoherent
fluorescent light.

Late-2014: Bioprinting/lab on a chip
--------------------------------------

    :width: 30%

* Duration: 20 hours
* Publication: PNAS
* Drawing tools: Inkscape, GIMP.

There is a need to illustrate the in-situ fabrication process as a spontaneous
operation with walk-away automation. Therefore, all the electronics (e.g. light
engine, FPGA) and control mechanisms (frame synchronization software) are
excluded from the drawings. The zoomed-in view further highlights the
3-dimensional constructs in microscopic scale, so I borrowed the style from
AA-sectional views of mechanical CAD drawings.
